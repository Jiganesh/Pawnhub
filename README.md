    Capturing works little different at pawnhub, When player plays a move which captures opponents pieces, after eliminating the opponents piece the playes piece demotes in Pawn piece
    
    <span style="color:orange;">How is this fair ?</span>

    Capturing pieces with same value is trick here, As higher value pieces gets demoted to pawn pieces player needs to evalute possible captures which doesnt put him at disadvantage. This makes the game more interesting.
